# SMILBridge

SMILBridge is a small GUI-focused project that serves as the connecting step between the core quiz logic from the [SMIL](https://github.com/smilsmilsmil/SMIL) repository and a fully interactive quiz application.

This repository focuses on experimenting with graphical interfaces and basic integration, laying the groundwork for SMILâ€™s complete GUI implementation.
